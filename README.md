# LumiGen

LumiGen is a de novo design framework for luminescent molecules with specific photophysical properties, featuring an integrated Molecular Generator, Spectral Discriminator, and Sampling Augmentor.

The Molecular Generator contains methods for transfer learning and molecular generation. The Spectral Discriminator includes methods for evaluating target optical properties. The Sampling Augmentor provides methods for iterative selection of elite subsets. The Results section presents the classification outcomes of MolElite and MolMediocrity after iterations.
